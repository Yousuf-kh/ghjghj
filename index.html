        <p>The BMW X6 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV by German automaker BMW. The BMW X6 is the originator of the
            sports activity coupé (SAC), referencing its sloping rear roof design. It combines the attributes of an SUV
            (high ground clearance, all-wheel drive and all-weather ability, large wheels and tires) with the stance of
            a coupé (styling featuring a sloping roof). It is built in BMW's North American plant in Greer, South
            Carolina alongside the BMW X5, whose platform it shares. Prior to the release of the X7, the X6 was
            considered a flagship SUV for BMW.

            The first generation (E71) was released for sale in April 2008 for the 2008 model year, while the
            second-generation X6 (F16) was launched at the Paris Motor Show in 2014. The third-generation X6 was
            revealed in July 2019.</p>

        <p>The BMW M5 is a high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. It is
            considered an iconic vehicle in the sports saloon category.[1][2] The M5 has always been produced in the
            saloon (sedan, US English) body style, but in some countries the M5 has also been available as an estate
            (wagon, US English) from 1992 to 1995, from 2006 to 2010, and since 2024.[3][4][5]

            The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from
            the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.[6] M5 models have been produced for every
            generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</p>
